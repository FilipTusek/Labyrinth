# Labyrinth

Excersize to showcase A* pathfinding algorithm. 

The algorithm could be further improved with Unity DOTS, but there is only one path being calculated at the time so there is no need for that.

Level editor is very crude and could be very improved, but it was not the goal of this excersize. It was implemented for testing simplification.
